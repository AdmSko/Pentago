# Pentago
Swedish game called "Pentago"
program contains game called "Pentago". Each player move is - 1.pick place of symbol 2. rotating whole board. 
If u have never heard about this game you can always use "h" in menu to learn how to play :). 
Game is fully written in C++, ASCII code as base board visual, sadly game is in Polish from the view of a player.
About actual code: It's one of my first "bigger" projects, don't even look into a code because it doesn't make sense.
Too much copying, for example menu code which could me written with one function and not rewritten everytime.
Let's say this program gives me perspective on how much i have learned since entering university and how i would change it for better.
Honestly - i would love to throw it as far as possible and write it from scratch..
